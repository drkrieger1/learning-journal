Made it to week two and holy cow these guys weren't kidding about it getting hard.  Mondays lad was a tough one, I had the right idea of what I wanted to do but couldn't remember the right format to write it in code, I feel like this will get ironed out with more practice. I was able to find a solution with my peer codefellowerâ€™s. Reading through the code it make scene to me but coming to the conclusion on my own is an issue.
