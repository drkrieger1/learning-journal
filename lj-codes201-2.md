Learning journal entry number two, whelp I am still treading water. The loop/array assessment from day three was a tricky one but with the help of my classmates I was able to get my code to work.

The peer programing exercise was weird but its a good one, it real helped me understand the logic of FOR and WHILE loops by having to explain  it to my partner.
