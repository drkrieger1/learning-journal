Finished up week two strong, Mondays lab doesn't seem as bad as it did Monday. My goal for this weekend is to go over the reading on JS events in my text book and spend a lot of time working with HTML and CSS. I understand the language just need lots of practice. I also need to work on my getting my assignments in on time.  Maybe its time to set a daily check list before going to bed.
