# Lj Code 301 Day 3

Todays lab was hard but not as difficult i thought it would be. I am having more problems with my portfolio project and its css. This is mostly because i am just running out of steam focusing on the daily labs. This 301 course is a lot tougher than the 201 for sure but so far mostly because of all the different assignments we have to make time for.
