#LJ Day 15

To day we reviewed just about all of the subjects that have bin covered in this 301 course. We then broke up into our project week teams and started our planning. So far my teams idea is to make an app that uses the king counting health inspection data to display it around your area, like yelp except instead of user review you get health inspection ratings. As a stretch goal we might try to use the yelp API as well but that will depend how much time we have.
